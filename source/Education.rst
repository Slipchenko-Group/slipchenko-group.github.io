Computational Quantum Chemistry (CHM 673) is a graduate level course that opens students up to the area of developed 
quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical principles optimized by compuational models for the estimation of atomic
and molecular properties for the evaluation of structural and functional behavior of both microscopic and extended 
systems. Lecture entails the fundamentals of molecular simulations, molecular potential energy surfaces (modeling 
chemical reactions), basic approximations (Hartree-Fock theory), electron correlation methods 
(Configuration Interaction, Perturbation Theory, Coupled Cluster Methods), density functional theory, chemistry of
open-shells and excited states(multireference methods, methods for excited states, TD-DFT), modeling of large and 
periodic systems (Solvation models, QM/MM, fragmentation methods).
