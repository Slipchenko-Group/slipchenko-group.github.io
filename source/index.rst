We are computational chemists interested in understanding interplay between structure and 
function in condensed-phase molecular systems. Some of the exciting problems we work with are

- how do photosynthetic proteins control energy and charge tranfer?
- what is the role of vibronic interactions in energy tranfer and how are they affected by a protein environment?
- what is the physical make-up of the interactions controling binding in protein-ligand complexes and molecular crystals?

To address these and other questions, we use community molecular modeling software and develop our own tools.
